1.001002 - 2018-02-23
      - fixed author metadata
      - added x_static_install and dynamic_config=0 to metadata
      - added x_authority to metadata

1.001_001 - 2018-02-15
      - list test prerequisites as test prerequisites rather than runtime
        prerequisites. (RT#100637)
      - correctly list Test::More 0.96 as a test prerequisite (RT#77611)
      - stop using Class::C3 in tests.  it is still listed as a prerequisite.
        because some things expect it to be available once this module is
        installed.
      - convert packaging from using Module::Install to plain
        ExtUtils::MakeMaker, with Distar for releasing.  This fixes issues when
        the current directory is not in @INC (perl 5.26).  Fixes RT#121696,
        RT#120826
      - fixed typo in documentation. (RT#85355)
      - fixed module abstracts.
      - increase Class::Inspector prereq to 1.32 to fix ensure_class_found on
        modules provided by @INC hooks, such as PAR. (RT#42845)

        is negligent enough to change it (RT#66661)
      - Added missing copyright statement
